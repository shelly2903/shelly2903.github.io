				<h3> Professional Placement Experience</h3>
				<ol>
					<li> St Patricks College Strathfield: 15 days/ 3 weeks in Second Year of Uni during end of Term 2 in school term</li> 
					<p> During my time here I had the opportunity to teach year 7 technology mandatory, in partiuclar the topic of food and agricluture. I also taught stage 5, year 9, food technology. Focusing on theory rather than practice but this okay, as I enjoyed my time here</p>
					<li> Georges River College Peakhurst: 15 days/ 3 weeks in Second Year of Uni during end of Term 4 in school term</li>
				    <p> During my time here I had the opportunity to teach year 8 enginnering, 7 textiles, 9 IST and 10 Food technology. This diversity helped me build my skills in new areas such as engineering</p>
					<li>Homebush Boys Public School Homebush: 15 days/ 3 weeks in Second Year of Uni during end of Term 2 beginning of term 3 in school term</li>

				</ol>

				<h3> Paid Experience</h3>
				<p>In addition to the three placements, I have also been forunate to work in the OOSH (out of school hours) sector for various primary schools under the hamilton company and this has given me the opprountiy to learn, socialise and disover the cognitive development of each year level in primary school and learn how this development continunes into a highschool setting. Being able to identify the thinking patterns of students prior to year 7 (i.e in primary school) allows me to better understand the cognitive abilities of year 7s I will go on to teach</p>
