					<p> Hi! My name is Michelle and I am currently studying a double degree titled
					A Bachelor of Education (Secondary) / Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technologies)
					so I can become a TAS (Technology Applied Studies) teacher. I want to major in Food Technology (Teach till year 12)
					and minor in Textiles and IT (Teach till year 10)</p>

					<h3>Values and Beliefs</h3>
					<p>I value <i>Collaboration</i> and want my classes to be one filled with teamwork and <i>self-motivated</i> learning where <i>creativity></i> is fostered through <i>communication, collaboration and open-mindness</i> 
					where a lack of judgment by <u>ALL</u> parties within the classroom. There is not such thing as a bad idea or bad question, its just an idea or a question</p>
					<p> I want there to be a <i>commitment</i> to learning for both teachers and students alike. I want students to feel <i>secure</i> and to know I am there to support them, helping to build a sense of <i>belonging</i> </p>
					<p>With these values above my classroom will be a place of <i>excellence</i> where students strive for <i>perfection</i> but in a way where they learn from their mistakes and be held <i>accountable</i></p>
					<p>These values have been implemented at <b>each</b> teaching opportunity across my last three placements for more information</p>      
				 
				<div id="line_style2"> 
					<h4>My teaching goals include:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Building a professional relationship with students. Knowing their interests allows me to engage them better </li>
						<li>Boosting student performance</li>
						<li> Collaboration and creativity</li>
						<li>Organization and accountability</li>
						<li>An awareness of local community and how to give back</li>
					</ol> 
				</div> 
											<h3>My Teaching Philosphy</h3>
											<p>By honoring the values of security and belonging along with an open-minded attitude the learners in my classroom can feel as if they belong in an inclusive learning environment.
												I want my teaching to centre around inquiry-based learning or opportunities for students to problem solve and explore real-world scenarios. 
												As mentioned previously I value group work however I also appreciate the importance of testing individuals within the “group” to see what “exactly” they know. 
												This is important because “to teach is to know the individual and their learning style and needs”. 
												The theorists which inform my learning style are Vygotsky, students learning through social interaction and mimicking as well as Piaget's cognitive development stages and B.F skinner's positive reinforcement studies. 
												For me to know if the students have learnt the content I usually write questions as part of a conclusion or “exit ticket”. Worksheets are also a wonderful way to assess learning. 
												In conclusion, I always try my best to use my beliefs to inform my teaching practise.
