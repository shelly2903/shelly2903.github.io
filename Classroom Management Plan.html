                <h3>Classroom Managament Plan</h3>
                <p> As a teacher, my approach to managing classroom behavior is centered on collaboration and respect. I also believe that both teacher and students should strive towards consistency, as this is the key to postive results.  I believe that creating a positive learning environment starts with establishing clear expectations, which is why I involve my students in constructing our classroom rules through open negotiation. This not only fosters a sense of ownership but also ensures that the rules are relevant and meaningful to everyone. In terms of addressing behaviour, I prefer to guide students back on track rather than simply correcting them, this can mean reminding students of the task when I notice they are off track, being proactive is much better than being reactive. (Below is a summary of how I would incorporate the 3-tier PBS model in a classroom setting) I aim to employ strategies that focus on understanding the underlying causes of behavior, offering constructive feedback, and setting up opportunities for students to make better choices (By providing take-time and choices for the students to consider). To encourage positive behavior, I aim to use a variety of reinforcement techniques, including verbal praise, written recognition of effort, and creating a supportive classroom culture where every student feels valued and motivated to contribute positively. </p>
				<h3><u>Classroom Rules Examples</u></h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Arrive on Time with All Necessary Equipment</li>
						     <ul> 
							 <li>Sets a standard for punctuality and being prepared,which are essential skills for high school students. </li>
						     </ul>
						</li>
						<li>Show Respect to Both Teachers and Classmates</li>
						    <ul> 
								<li>Respect is the foundation for establishing a positive classroom culture/Postive Learning Environment (PLE).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Ask Questions and Participate Without Interrupting</li>
							<ul> 
						        <li>Encourages engagement via asking questions but reminds students of the need for classroom order AND the need to <b>respect</b> other students rights to learn.</li>
							</ul>
						</li> 
						<li>Embrace Challenges, Keep an Open Mind, and Value Creativity</li>
					       <ul> 
							<li>Encourages students to approach learning with curiosity, be willing to take on new challenges, and appreciate the creative process, while also fostering a learning environment built on inclusion and <b>respect</b>.</li>
						     </ul>
						</li> 
						<li>Work Hard, Try Your Best, and Be Honest in Your Efforts</li>
				    	      <ul>
						      <li>Highlights AND reminds students that dedication and honesty lead to sucess in the classroom. It encourages students to again, <b>embrace challenges</b> , maintain integrity AND put in their best efforts (apply themselves entirely)</li>
				              	</ul>
				         </li> 
						<li>Use Technology and School Property Responsibly</li>
						    <ul>
						     <li>Reminds students to use ALL property INCLUDING technolgical devices with safety and care as well as ethically (this would align with exisiting school policies, where students are asked to use technology for educational purposes)</li>
					        </ul>  
					     </li>
					</ol>
				<p>After reading the rules it is clear that <b> respect and embracing challanges</b> are key themes that I want to encourage in my students</p>
